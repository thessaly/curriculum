    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      <h2>Research</h2>

      I conduct qualitative, multiple and single case study research, which I often complement with quantitative data analysis. This includes experience in grant writing, research design, data collection (participant observation, interviews, workshops and policy sessions), data analysis using CAQDAS, writing and editing peer-reviewed articles, policy briefs and pieces for the general public.<br><br>

      <h2>Education</h2>

      I contribute to programmes in the intersection of innovation, technology and society. I am one of the [curriculum designers](https://curriculum.openhardware.space) of the community-based programme [Open Hardware Makers](https://openhardware.space); I co-created [educational games](https://ohwmakers.github.io/treasure-hunt/), delivered training sessions on [open science tools](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Events/Wikidata_EPFL2019), and worked as a [mentor](https://sdgsolutionspace.org/education-programs/summer-school/summer-school-2018/) for Masters' projects towards the Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br>

      <h2>Advocacy</h2>

      I co-founded [reGOSH](https//regosh.libres.cc), a network in Latin America for promoting open science hardware; I run a global [mentorship programme](https://openhardware.space) for open hardware practitioners; and I created and facilitate monthly meetings of an online research community. I've been an invited speaker at [academic conferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL4mFMpgOXA) and [community gatherings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbCeRCjpo14), I presented at policy [events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngeUhFk1bWk), and was [consulted](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000375219) for the regional UNESCO recommendation on open science. I wrote policy briefs based on community discussions and have collaborated with think tanks like the Woodrow Wilson Center as a lead author. <br><br>
